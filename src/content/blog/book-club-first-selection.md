We're thrilled to announce our first book club selection: **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** by Martin Kleppmann.

## About the Book

Often called "DDIA," this book is essential reading for anyone working with distributed systems, databases, or large-scale applications. Martin Kleppmann provides a comprehensive overview of the principles and trade-offs involved in building reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems.

### What We'll Cover

The book is divided into three main parts:

1. **Foundations of Data Systems** - Storage engines, data models, and encoding
2. **Distributed Data** - Replication, partitioning, and transactions
3. **Derived Data** - Batch processing, stream processing, and the future of data systems

## Meeting Schedule

We'll meet **every other Thursday at 6:30 PM** starting February 6th. Each session will cover 2-3 chapters, giving everyone time to read and reflect.

### Upcoming Sessions

- **Feb 6**: Chapters 1-2 (Introduction & Data Models)
- **Feb 20**: Chapters 3-4 (Storage & Encoding)
- **Mar 6**: Chapters 5-6 (Replication)
- More sessions TBA

## How to Participate

1. **Get the book** - Available in print, Kindle, or audiobook format
2. **[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/k3rZXhmBjf)** - We have a dedicated channel for book club discussions
3. **Mark your calendar** - Meeting details will be posted in Discord

## Why This Book Matters

Whether you're building web applications, working with databases, or designing distributed systems, DDIA provides the conceptual foundation you need. The principles in this book apply across programming languages and specific technologies.

Even if you can't attend every session, the book is worth reading on your own. We'll share discussion notes and insights in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/k3rZXhmBjf).
